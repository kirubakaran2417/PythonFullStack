# Problem Description: Lucky Number Guessing Game
# Objective
# Create a Python program that allows the user to play a "lucky number guessing game." 
# The program will randomly select a number between 1 and 10 (inclusive), and the user must guess the number. 
# The program will provide feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess was too low, too high, or correct. 
# The game continues until the user guesses the correct number, and the program will display the total number of attempts taken.

# Requirements
# Random Number Generation

# The program should generate a random integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive) at the start of the game.
# User Input

# The program should repeatedly prompt the user to guess the lucky number.

# Feedback

# If the user's guess is lower than the lucky number, print:
# "Too low! Try again."
# If the user's guess is higher than the lucky number, print:
# "Too high! Try again."
# If the user's guess is correct, print:
# "Congratulations! You've guessed my lucky number {number} in {attempts} attempts."
# (Replace {number} and {attempts} with the actual values.)
# Attempts Counter

# The program should keep track of the number of guesses the user makes.
# Looping

# The guessing process should continue until the user guesses the correct number.
# Input Validation (Optional Enhancement)

# Optionally, handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values or numbers outside the range 1â€“10) gracefully.
